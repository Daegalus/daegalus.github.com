I am a college student at San Jose State University, and pretty much try to do too much all at once. I am studying Computer Science, and a programmer. I do a lot of little things for myself, and I generally don't have anything worthwhile to share, but I am going to be working on more open-source projects, so I will eventually be posting all that to Bitbucket and Github.
