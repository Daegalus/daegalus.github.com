Well, I am going to take a swing at blogging once more. I have tried a few times, but I can just never get it right. Hopefully this time around I can be active about it and maybe write something useful. If not, I can just put another grave in my "Things that just don't work for me" box alongside Facebook.

I will most likely stick to technological/programming articles here, but there might be a few occasional ones that are just completely unrelated, but those will be filed under the appropriate tags.

I am also a gamer, so most of my other stuff might be related to gaming or something.

Hope this works out better than last time.

P.S. Just a test of syntax highlighted code on some Node.js stuff:

``` js
	var http = require('http');
	var server = http.createServer(function(req,res) {
	  res.writeHead(200);
	  res.end('Hello World');
	});
	server.listen(8124);

	var hello = require('./hello');
	hello.world();
```
